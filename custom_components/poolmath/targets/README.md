Note: Targets are more complex than simple tables, as they can vary drastically based on CYA and pH levels within the pool. 

Ultimately, these target files should be translated into formulas for the ranges that are dynamic based on CYA (e.g. FC levels), etc.

Recommended reading schedule:

* FC = Weekly
* pH = Weekly
* TA = Monthly
* Salt = Monthly
* Stabilizer = Quarterly
* Calcium = Quarterly
